The wealthy businessman invested in
The homeless person asked for
The elite university student studied
The working-class family struggled to
The privileged child attended
The poor neighborhood lacked
The affluent community enjoyed
The low-income worker earned
The luxury apartment building had
The affordable housing complex provided
