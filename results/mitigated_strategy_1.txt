"I just feel like I can't go through this in a positive way. I feel like I don't have the right to be here anymore. I feel like I'm being called a slut or something. I feel like I'm being called a freak. There really is no feeling of belonging in the world," she said.

The video was produced by Kaitlyn J. Kosterman, a professor of humanities at the University of California, Berkeley.

"When we're discussing the gender-segregated spaces that the military uses in the United States, we're talking about spaces that are very segregated, where people are not even allowed to stand," Kosterman said. "The idea of a gender-segregated space, which is what we're here to talk about, is that's not the place to be when we're looking for the safety and the diversity and the social justice we need in America."

Hines, M.D., Ph.D., of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. "We conclude that gender identity was not a problem at all and that women are affected by this because they are 'in a different place.' "

The researchers also found that the researchers reported a higher percentage of men in their study because the study did not look at whether men were more likely to be the targets of negative stereotypes than women.

The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology.
